# MILP_to_Collaborative_Missions_with_Heterogeneous_Teams_using_Pulp

Implemented a Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulation which optimizes and performs spatial Task allocation and
scheduling heterogeneous Teams. 

Implemented the algorithm on real robots using Ros and Gazebo simulator. 

The implementation is on centralized and decentralized approaches.
